### Project Name
**“Viral Wave Project”**

### Project Description
The Viral Wave Project leverages data-driven analysis to identify and understand viral short-form content trends across popular platforms such as YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok. Initially, the project will focus on rapidly creating and sharing "reactionary" short-form videos sourced from trending community posts on YouTube Shorts to capture user engagement metrics. Once a successful channel with consistently high views is established, the project will replicate the same content format on Instagram Reels and TikTok to analyze and compare audience reactions across platforms.

### Objectives
- Utilize big data analytics to discover factors contributing to the virality of short-form content.
- Compare cross-platform reactions to identical content to refine and develop effective multi-platform content strategies.
- Establish a sustainable growth model for short-form content channels based on data-driven insights.

### Expected Outcomes
- Identification of viral content patterns and platform-specific characteristics that accelerate audience engagement.
- Enhanced marketing efficiency through strategic, data-backed content creation.
- Exploration of new content business opportunities leveraging big data insights.
